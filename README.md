# EDA-and-Predicting-Stock-Prices-using-ML-DL
** In this project we will train a Ridge Regression Model  and Deep Neural Network Model to predict the future Stock Price.
** By accurately predicting stock price , the investor can maximize returns and know when buy/sell securities.
** The AI/ML model will be trained using historic stock price data , along with the volume of transactions.
** We will use a type of Neural Network known as LSTM(Long Short Term Memory).
